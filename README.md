# RustTracer

A toy raytracer built in rust for Winter Wonderhack 2023.

Primarily developed to get me friendly with Rust as a language.

Current features: Diffuse shading and reflection, paramaterized resolution and reflection depth

Planned features: Specular shading for glossy surfaces and file input for loading images
